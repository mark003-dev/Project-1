  <h1>About Me.</h1>
  <p>My name is Mark and I have spent the last six years in the United States Air Force.</p>
  <P>I have recently separated and am looking to expand my skillset into the digital world!</p>
  <p>I have been exploring into HTML for this class and am very excited for CSS and JavaScript!</p>
	<p>Some other things I have been exploring into include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Networking</li>
      <li>Virtualization</li>
      <li>Operating Systems(Linux, Windows, etc..)</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Recent Projects</h2>
	<p>One of the most recent projects I have done regarding networking and operating systems is the addition of a DNS sinkhole.</p>
  <p>A DNS(Domain Name System) sinkhole is a cybersecurity measure that redirects DNS requests to a server on your network before reaching a client.</p>
  <p>An example of this is advertising. When streaming things like YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, etc. you will recieve ads attempting to sell you an item or service.</p>
	<p>Most people find this quite annoying(myself included) and a DNS sinkhole intercepts those ads and blocks them from reaching the device you are streaming from.</p>
	<p>Introducing PiHole!!!</p>
  <img src="media/Dashboard.png" alt="PiHole Dashboard Example">
	<p>PiHole is the DNS sinkhole that you run on a server attached to your network. As the name implies it is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi and doesn't require much resources.</p>
  <p>This is the computer I am running PiHole on.</p>
  <img src="media/Computer.jpg" alt="HP Elitedesk 705 G3 mini">
  <p>This computer is a cheap HP Elitedesk 705 G3 mini that was bound for a landfill.</p>
  <p>I upgraded the RAM to its maximum of 16GB of DDR4 and installed a 1TB M.2 SSD and now this computer is used to run both my PiHole and game servers for my friends and I.</p>
